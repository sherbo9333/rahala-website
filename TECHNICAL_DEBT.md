# Technical Debt Log

Non-critical observations noted during later phases, deliberately **not** acted on so as not to modify frozen/completed pages. Address these in a dedicated cleanup pass when convenient, or fold into a future phase if a page is reopened for other reasons.

---

### TD-001 — About page's Open Graph/Twitter title doesn't reflect the page title
**Noted:** Phase 5.4 (verifying Services page SEO)
**Where:** `src/app/about/page.tsx`
**Detail:** About's `metadata` export sets `title`/`description`/`alternates.canonical` but no explicit `openGraph`/`twitter` objects. Next.js does not deep-merge nested metadata fields from a child route into the parent's `openGraph`/`twitter` — so About's actual `og:title`/`twitter:title` tags currently fall back to the root layout's site-wide default ("رحالة | شريكك الاستراتيجي في النمو الرقمي") instead of "من نحن | رحالة". Services and Industries (built after this was noticed) both set explicit `openGraph`/`twitter` objects and don't have this gap.
**Fix:** Add the same explicit `openGraph`/`twitter` block to About's metadata that Services/Industries already use. Low effort, purely additive, no visual/layout change — safe to do whenever About is reopened, or as a standalone metadata-only patch if you'd rather not wait.
**Severity:** Low (doesn't affect the page itself, only how it previews when shared on social/search).

### TD-002 — Mega-menu and footer link to 6 service detail routes that don't exist yet
**Noted:** Phase 5.1 (pre-existing), reconfirmed Phase 5.4
**Where:** `src/data/navigation.ts` (`services[].href` → `/services/digital-strategy`, etc.), consumed by `Header`'s `ServicesMegaMenu`, `MobileMenu`, and `Footer`
**Detail:** These six routes will 404 until individual service detail pages are built in a future phase. This is expected, pre-existing state from before Phase 5.4 — not a regression introduced by any completed phase.
**Fix:** Build the six `/services/[slug]` pages in a future phase (not currently scoped).
**Severity:** Low while the site isn't live; becomes Medium once deployed publicly (dead links from primary nav).

*No new technical debt introduced in Phase 5.5 (Industries).*

### TD-003 — Timeline wrapper markup duplicated between Home and Methodology page
**Noted:** Phase 5.6 (Methodology)
**Where:** `src/components/home/MethodologySection.tsx` (frozen) vs. `src/components/methodology/ProcessTimelineSection.tsx` (new)
**Detail:** Both components render the same horizontal/vertical `NumberedStep` arrangement (connecting line + responsive orientation switch). The actual repeated visual unit (`NumberedStep`) is properly reused in both places — only the surrounding grid/connecting-line wrapper (a small amount of markup) is duplicated. This is deliberate: extracting a shared `MethodologyTimeline` primitive would require modifying Home's `MethodologySection.tsx`, which is frozen this phase.
**Fix:** If Home is ever reopened for other reasons, extract a shared `MethodologyTimeline` component (parameterized by whether to show the loop-back indicator) and have both Home and Methodology consume it.
**Severity:** Low — cosmetic code duplication, not a functional or visual bug. Both components independently pass all validation.

*No new technical debt introduced in Phase 5.6 beyond TD-003.*

### TD-004 — Checklist-row pattern duplicated between Methodology and Why Rahala pages
**Noted:** Phase 5.7 (Why Rahala)
**Where:** `src/components/methodology/WhyProcessWorksSection.tsx` (frozen) vs. `src/components/why-rahala/CompetitiveAdvantagesSection.tsx` (new)
**Detail:** Both render the same "CheckCircle2 icon + title + description" checklist-row visual pattern (matching the PDF's own check-marked list treatment of its Advantages content in both places). Consistent with the TD-003 precedent: the shared pattern isn't extracted into one component because doing so would require modifying Methodology's frozen file.
**Fix:** If Methodology is ever reopened, extract a shared `ChecklistItem` (or similar) primitive and have both pages consume it. Until then, both are independently correct and pass all validation.
**Severity:** Low — cosmetic duplication, not a functional or visual bug.
